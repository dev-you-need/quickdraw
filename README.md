Android version of https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com

This is an android application that uses a neural network on android. It was released on Google Play in 2017, but a few years later it was removed from there due to copyright violation, although resources were used only with an open-source license with a link to the source.

The code is not very up to date at the moment, there are more modern implementations of using Tensorflow.
